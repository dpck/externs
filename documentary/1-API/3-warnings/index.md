## Warnings And Todos

There were warnings that were emitted during the generation of each extern. Those warnings needed to be fixed manually. There are also `TODO` statements generated by `tsickle` that could not perform some analysis. They also needed (and still need) to be fixed manually.

`tsickle` is not able to handle:

- *`PropertySignature`*:
    ```ts
    export interface IncomingHttpHeaders { 'accept'?: string; }
    ```
- *`IncludesNonWideningType`*:
    ```ts
    export type ServerOptions = tls.SecureContextOptions & tls.TlsOptions;
    ```
- *`omitting interface deriving from class`* (not always):
    ```ts
    export interface ReadableStream extends EventEmitter { }
    ```
- *`omitting heritage reference to a type/value`* (not sure wat):
    ```ts
    export interface ErrnoException extends Error { }
    ```

> *omitting interface deriving from class*
> For some reason, the class will not always be able to extend another class. E.g., the `@extends {event.EventEmitter}` has to be added manually in many files that rely on it.

### Export = internal

`Events` and `Stream` have a typed structure that exports an `internal` property:

```ts
declare module "events" {
  class internal extends NodeJS.EventEmitter { }

  namespace internal {
    export class EventEmitter extends internal {
      static listenerCount(emitter: EventEmitter, event: string | symbol): number;
      ...
    }
  }

  export = internal;
}
```

This will result in externs having the `internal` property:

```js
/**
 * @param {(string|symbol)} type
 * @return {number}
 */
events.internal.EventEmitter.prototype.listenerCount = function(type) {};
```

This is obviously incorrect, so that `.internal` needs to be removed manually.
